# AgentPay Subscription Manager

A subscription management platform that allows users to track their active subscriptions and pay for them using AgentPay via Coinbase's AgentKit. Users can see a list of platforms (e.g., Netflix, YouTube, Spotify) they're subscribed to and make payments using crypto, simplifying subscription payments.

## Features
- **Dashboard**: View all active subscriptions in one place.
- **Subscription List**: See detailed information about each subscription (platform, plan, next payment date, etc.).
- **Payment Interface**: Make payments using AgentPay for each subscription.
- **Payment History**: Track payments and manage subscriptions easily.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (for building dynamic UI components)
- **State Management**: React useState & useEffect (for handling subscriptions data)
- **Routing**: React Router (for navigation)
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios (for fetching subscription data and processing payments)
- **Styling**: Plain CSS (could be enhanced with TailwindCSS or Material-UI)
